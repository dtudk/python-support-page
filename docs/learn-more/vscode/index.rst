Visual Studio Code
===================

Similarly to IDLE, VS Code is a place to write your Python code. VS Code is great for larger projects. It is useful for things like debugging, organizing files and collaborating with other people for coding.
It also comes with extensions that can improve visual clarity, help you collaborate with 
others and a particularly useful type of file called Jupyter notebooks. 

We have created two tutorials that will introduce you to two different type of files and workflows:

.. toctree:: 
   :maxdepth: 1
   
   python-script
   jupyter-notebooks


.. note::
    If you are in your first year, you probably will not need to use VS Code until **week 7 or 8 of your studies**. Just remember that this page is here to get you started with some basic tips whenever you need.
