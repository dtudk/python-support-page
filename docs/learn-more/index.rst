Core tools
===========

Here you can find the essential tools needed to run and utilize Python during your first year at DTU as a Bachelor student. 

We strongly recommend first year students or those new to programming to go through the :doc:`Terminal <terminal>`
and :doc:`IDLE <idle>` sections after installing Python. 

:doc:`Visual Studio Code <vscode>` will be introduced around week 7, and
there's no need to rush into this section. However, we encourage you to get a head start 
by exploring it whenever you have some spare time.

You should only dive into :doc:`Packages and Environments <packages-and-environments>` after you've 
completed the others and have some free time, given that it won't be necessary during your first semester. 
Nonetheless, this section will help you troubleshoot issues independently, and will be of great value during your education.
