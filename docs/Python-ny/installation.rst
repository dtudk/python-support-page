Getting started with python
=================

.. tip:: 
    We suggest removing any pre-installed Python versions and VS Code before 
    proceeding with this  guide to ensure a smooth installation process. You can refer to this guide to walk you through the uninstallation process, ensuring you're all set to get started.




1. **Download Python**


.. tab:: {{ windows }}

    For a hassle-free Python download & installation experience, we recommend grabbing it straight from the Microsoft Store. However, if you find yourself on an adventurous detour and can't access it there,  you can still opt for the OG Python release.



.. tab:: {{ macos }}

    You can download python directly from here.



.. tab:: {{ linux }}

    In progress:
        1. bla bla bla
        2. bla bla 




2. **Installation** 

.. warning::
    If you did not download python through Microsoft Store, then you need to make sure 
    that you check the "Add to path" box during the installation.
