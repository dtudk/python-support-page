DTU Python Installation Support
===============================

..
	.. card:: Python Installation Support open!
	   :class-card: sd-color-info

	   The Python Installation Support is open again in the spring semester.

	   Our `Discord <ps-discord-invite_>`_ channel is still open for students
	   to interact with each other.

Welcome to the DTU Python Installation student support unit!  
We are here to help you with Python installation problems related
to courses at DTU.

Our goal is to ensure that students can get a Python
environment up and running according to the needs of DTU courses.  
Help can be requested through various channels:

..    Should these (below) be here? Or is the above enough?

.. Office hours
..    we will have physical presence at DTU Lyngby campus on differing locations
..    depending on the used lecture rooms in the Polytechnical Foundation courses.
..    See further down for our locations during specific weeks of the semester.
..    This page will be updated continuously.

.. Mail -- :mail:`pythonsupport@dtu.dk`  |  {{online_days}} in the evening
