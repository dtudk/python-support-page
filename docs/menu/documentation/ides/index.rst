Editors / IDE's
========================================


IDE's is an engineers integral work-horse for creating and executing code.
Any code, in any language, can be written in any text-editor. However,
integrated development environments (IDE's) will extend the editor functionality
and aid the programmer in various ways, either by creating tooltips when typing code
or spell checking, and many other things.
Therefore choosing and becoming comfortable with an IDE can greatly improve
the turn around for the developer.

.. note::
   
   It is recommended that you use :ref:`VS Code <ide-vscode>` when beginning
   your studies at DTU.
   This will be the default IDE for all Polytechnical Foundation courses.

   If you later wish to play around with other IDE's, feel free to do so.
   They are all similar, and different at the same time.

   Please note if course teachers recommends a specific IDE.
