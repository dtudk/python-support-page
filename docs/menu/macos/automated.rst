MacOS - Automated installation guide
================================
.. warning::
    
    The following guide will help you execute a script that will install Python and Visual Studio Code on your MacOS device. I.e. everything you will need to get started with python programming. If you do not feel comfortable with this, refer to the manual installation guides. The contents of the script can be viewed `here <https://github.com/dtudk/pythonsupport-scripts/blob/main/AutoInstallMacOS.sh>`_. 

First open your ``terminal``. This can be done by pressing ``command`` + ``space``. There after search for ``terminal``.
Next, you need to copy the following line of code into your terminal and press enter.

.. hint:: 
    You can copy the lines by clicking the icon in the top right corner of the code block. 

.. code-block:: 
    
    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dtudk/pythonsupport-scripts/main/AutoInstallMacOS.sh)"

Please follow the instructions that appear once you've pressed enter. You might get asked for permissions and your password to make changes on your mac. 
Once the script is finished, python and Visual Studio Code will be ready to use.

.. hint::
    
   When typing your password, you won't see any characters being typed. This is normal. Just type your password and press enter.  


.. note::
      
      The script will take a while to finish, so please be patient. If you encounter any problems, feel free to reach out for help.
