"""Time table automatic creator

This time table creator will automatically
create the input for the timetable to ensure it is
always up to date.

In conjunction with running the web-page on a weekly basis
we can automatically ensure that the information is up to date.

It does this by reading a configuration file at the top of the documentation
and calculating the current week, and comparing this to the semester week.

The current week *preferred* will be listed depending on the build-time of the
document.
After 18 on a Friday, the preferred week-number will be the following week.
