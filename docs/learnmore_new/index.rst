Core tools
===================================

Here you can find the essential tools needed to run and utilize Python during your first year at DTU as a Bachelor student. 

We strongly recommend first year students or those new to programming to go through the :doc:`Terminal <terminal>`
and :doc:`IDLE <condensedidle>` sections after installing Python. 

Although :doc:Visual Studio Code <vscode> will be introduced around week 7, 
there's no need to rush into this section. However, we encourage you to get a head start 
by exploring it whenever you have some spare time.

Finally, although :doc:`Packages and Environments <packages_and_environments>` will be covered in more detail later in your education, 
it's beneficial to learn the basics early. This knowledge will be valuable throughout your engineering career 
and will help you troubleshoot issues independently, and we strongly recommend reviewing this section after completing the others.
