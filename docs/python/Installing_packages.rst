Installing packages
=========================================

When using Python, you will most likely need to import several packages in your script. 
Python comes with a standard library that includes many of the most common packages. 
However, some packages you wil need to install manually. 

Depending on which distribution of Python you are using, you will need to use a different package manager.

=========================================
Using the official Python distribution
=========================================
If you are using the official Python distribution, you will need to use the pip package manager.

On windows or on mac open a terminal and type:

.. code-block:: bash

  pip install <package name>


=========================================
Using a conda distribution
=========================================

If you are using a conda distribution, you will need to use the conda package manager.

On windows or on mac open a terminal and type:

.. code-block:: bash

  conda install <package name>
