Step 1: Install Miniconda
---------------------------

First thing you need to do is download Miniconda. This is done by going to `this website  <https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/index.html#latest-miniconda-installer-links>`_, and downloading the appropriate installer for your system.
Under the title "Latest Miniconda installer links", you will see different installers where you will have to download the correct one.
If you have an Intel processor you need to select Miniconda3 MacOS Intel x86 64-bit pkg.
If you have an M processor you need to select Miniconda3 MacOS Apple M1 64-bit pkg. Even if
you have an M2 or M3.

Now you need to open your terminal. This is done by pressing the "command" and "space" key at the same time and searching for "terminal".

.. todo::
    Insert image of spotlight search for terminal.

Copy and paste the following lines of cod einto your terminal and press enter one line at a time:

.. tip::
    You can copy and paste all code in the grey code blocks below by hovering your mouse over the block and pressing the icon in the top right.

.. code-block:: bash
        
    conda install python=3.11 -y
    
.. code-block:: bash

    conda install -c conda-forge dtumathtools uncertainties -y


Step 3: Install VS Code

.. tip::
    When you have finished the guide, we **strongly recommend** checking out the :ref:`Python Essentials <essentials-reference>` to prepare you for coding.

Verification and Quick Troubleshooting
--------------------------------------
Open up a terminal again. if you see ``(base)`` next to your username, you can proceed. Otherwise
try to install miniconda again. Miniconda can be found on `this website  <https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/index.html#latest-miniconda-installer-links>`_. 
For further information, see step 1 :ref:`here <fully-manual-reference-mac>`

.. todo::
    Insert image of the terminal with (base) next to the username

Make sure that it says ``(base)`` next to your user name when opening the terminal.

Finally type ``idle3`` in the terminal and press enter. This should open up a new window in which you will able to run python code.

Now ensure the following:

• It says Python 3.11.xx in the top left.
• You get no errors when typing ``import dtumathtools, uncertainties`` and press enter. This should open a new line without any text, as shown bellow.

.. todo::
    Insert image of ``idle3`` after import dtumathtools and uncertainties so they can see what it should look like.


If it is not the case for one of the above, try to paste the following line of code in the terminal and press enter:

.. code-block:: bash

     conda install -c conda-forge python=3.11 dtumathtools uncertainties -y
